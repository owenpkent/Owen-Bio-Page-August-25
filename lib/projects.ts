Currently in development, the project aims to challenge Hollywood\'s traditional narratives about disability and create a thriller that\'s both entertaining and groundbreaking in its representation. The film explores how society\'s perceptions of disability can be both a weapon and a shield, and how true justice sometimes requires unconventional methods.',
